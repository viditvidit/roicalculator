# ROICalculator

## Brief Overview

This is a shiny app for calculating the return on investment (ROI) for large mining operations on digitising fuel accounting, dispatch and auditing. 
The shiny app has options to set fleet size and fuel volumes, and also set base salaries of people involved in the process. 
It will then calculate the man hours saved and its equivalent cost savings, as well as the ROI on digitising the process.
